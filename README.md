# Competition Outline

Following the success of the previous editions at IEEE PES-GM, CEC, GECCO, and WCCI, we are launching another challenging edition of the competition at major conferences in the field of computational intelligence and power systems. This CEC and GECCO 2025 competition proposes one track in the energy domain associated with the risk-based optimization of aggregators’ day-ahead energy resource management (ERM), considering uncertainty associated with the high penetration of distributed energy resources (DER). This testbed is constructed under the same framework of past competitions (therefore, former competitors can adapt their algorithms to this new track), representing a centralized day-ahead ERM in a smart grid with a 13-bus distribution network using a 15-scenario case study with 3 scenarios considering extreme events (high impact, and low probability). A conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) mechanism measures the risk associated with extreme events for a confidence level (α) of 95%. We also add some restrictions to the way in which initial solutions are generated. Finally, as in previous editions, manual repairs in the variables and tweak heuristics are not allowed.

Note: The track is developed to run under the same framework as past competitions.
